Certainly! Here's an updated version of the slide outline with a focus on highlighting the Spectral and Backstage POCs:

---

### **Title: API Framework Creation & Integration with Orchestra**

---

#### **Problem Statement:**
- **Lack of Standardization:** Microservices across the organization were implemented inconsistently, leading to increased complexity and reduced maintainability.
- **Integration Challenges:** Difficulty in integrating microservices into the org-wide portal, Orchestra, leading to inefficiencies.
- **Governance Gaps:** Absence of robust API governance led to potential security and performance issues.

---

#### **Solution:**
- **Standardization through API Framework:** Developed a standardized API framework that ensures consistent implementation of cross-cutting concerns (e.g., logging, security, error handling) across all microservices.
- **Integration with Orchestra:** Seamlessly integrated the framework with Orchestra, the in-house portal, to ensure smooth onboarding of new services and efficient service management.
- ****Spectral POC for API Governance:** Implemented a Proof of Concept using Spectral to introduce automated linting for all APIs. This enforced best practices and governance, ensuring all APIs conform to organizational standards.
- **Backstage POC for Service Catalog:** Piloted the use of Backstage to create a centralized service catalog. This enabled better service discoverability, improved developer onboarding, and streamlined microservices management.

---

#### **Tools & Technologies:**
- **API Framework Tools:** Spring Boot, OpenAPI, Custom Middleware
- **Orchestra Integration:** RESTful APIs, OAuth2, Custom Adapters
- **Governance Tools:**
  - **Spectral:** API linting to enforce best practices.
  - **Backstage:** Centralized service catalog for efficient management.

---

#### **Outcome:**
- **Improved Consistency:** All microservices now adhere to a standardized framework, reducing technical debt.
- **Enhanced Efficiency:** Faster and more reliable integration of microservices into Orchestra.
- **Robust Governance:**
  - **Spectral POC:** Resulted in higher API quality and security through automated linting.
  - **Backstage POC:** Simplified service management and enhanced developer experience.
- **Developer Experience:** Improved productivity and onboarding efficiency through Backstage.
