# Feature Description (Modified for Clarity on Current vs. Target State)

## Current State
The current process of updating dealer reserves in response to part payments is manual and inefficient. When a dealer makes a part payment, a PSS (Payment Support Services) team member manually creates a workflow request to update the dealer's reserve balance. This manual process introduces delays and is prone to human error. Additionally, the data required for this process is not standardized, leading to inconsistent data handling across systems, which further impacts the efficiency of reserve updates.

## Target State
In the target state, the system will automatically generate workflow requests when a dealer makes a part payment. These requests will be automatically routed to the PSS team, reducing manual involvement and improving speed and accuracy. The system will also handle data conversion into XCP format for seamless integration with downstream systems (ASVS, Q9, 1XN, and ICMP). A monitoring dashboard will be available to track workflows and alert the team to any errors, enabling quick intervention. This automated workflow will ensure dealer reserves are updated promptly and accurately, minimizing errors and enhancing operational efficiency.

# Elaborate User Stories (Revised)

## User Story 1: Automated Workflow Creation
**As a** PSS team member,  
**I want** an automated workflow to initiate requests for dealer reserves updates,  
**So that** I no longer need to perform this task manually, reducing delays and errors.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The system automatically generates a workflow request when a dealer makes a part payment.
- The workflow request includes all relevant information about the dealer and part payment details.
- The system sends a notification to the PSS team to confirm that a new workflow request has been created.

**BDD Test Cases:**
- **Given** a dealer makes a part payment,  
  **When** the system detects the payment,  
  **Then** an automated workflow request is created with relevant details and routed to the PSS team.

- **Given** a workflow request is automatically generated,  
  **When** the request is created,  
  **Then** a notification is sent to the PSS team.

## User Story 2: Automated Routing of Workflow Requests to External Systems
**As a** system,  
**I want** to automatically route workflow requests to specific external systems based on request type,  
**So that** each request reaches the appropriate destination without manual intervention.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Workflow requests are routed to the appropriate external systems (ASVS, Q9, 1XN, ICMP) based on predefined routing rules.
- Routing includes sending notifications and ensuring the request status is updated on the LTR 22 Dashboard.
- If routing fails, the system logs an error and retries up to three times before alerting the administrator.

**BDD Test Cases:**
- **Given** an automated workflow request is generated,  
  **When** the system processes the request for routing,  
  **Then** the request is routed to the appropriate external system based on its type.

- **Given** an automated workflow request is generated,  
  **When** the routing to an external system fails,  
  **Then** the system logs an error, retries up to three times, and alerts the administrator if all attempts fail.

## User Story 3: Automated Reserve Updates in Response to Part Payments
**As a** dealer,  
**I want** my part payments to automatically reflect in the reserve update workflow,  
**So that** my account reserves are updated accurately without delays.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- When a dealer makes a part payment, the system automatically processes the payment and updates the reserve.
- The system maintains a log of all reserve updates for audit purposes.
- In case of an update failure, the system logs the error and retries until it succeeds or alerts the PSS team.

**BDD Test Cases:**
- **Given** a dealer makes a part payment,  
  **When** the system processes the payment,  
  **Then** the dealerâ€™s reserve is updated automatically and a log is maintained.

- **Given** a reserve update fails,  
  **When** the system retries and fails again,  
  **Then** an alert is sent to the PSS team for manual intervention.

## User Story 4: Monitoring and Error Handling Dashboard
**As a** system administrator,  
**I want** a dashboard to track and monitor all automated workflow requests,  
**So that** I can ensure smooth operations and quickly address any errors.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- A dashboard displays all workflow requests, including their statuses (e.g., initiated, in-progress, completed, failed).
- The dashboard includes filtering options for quick access to failed or pending workflows.
- Alerts are generated for failed workflows and displayed on the dashboard for administrator intervention.

**BDD Test Cases:**
- **Given** an automated workflow request is initiated,  
  **When** there is a failure,  
  **Then** an alert is generated and displayed on the monitoring dashboard.

- **Given** the monitoring dashboard is accessed,  
  **When** a filter is applied for failed workflows,  
  **Then** only failed workflow requests are displayed.

## User Story 5: Detailed Workflow Request Information for PSS Team
**As a** PSS team member,  
**I want** to view all relevant details about the dealer and reserve in each workflow request,  
**So that** I can make accurate updates efficiently without needing additional data.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Workflow requests display complete dealer information, payment details, reserve amounts, and timestamp of the request.
- All fields are clearly labeled and accessible within the workflow request screen.
- The data is automatically fetched and populated in the workflow request to avoid manual entry errors.

**BDD Test Cases:**
- **Given** a workflow request is generated,  
  **When** a PSS team member opens the request,  
  **Then** all necessary information for the dealer and reserve update is visible.

- **Given** a workflow request is generated,  
  **When** the data fails to load,  
  **Then** an error message is displayed with an option to retry data loading.

## User Story 6: Data Conversion for Downstream Integration
**As a** system,  
**I want** to automatically convert the data format to XCP for further processing,  
**So that** the information can be seamlessly routed to multiple external systems in the correct format.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- The system converts workflow request data into XCP format as required before sending it to downstream systems.
- Conversion errors are logged, and the system retries up to three times before alerting an administrator.
- Converted data is validated to ensure it meets the requirements of each destination system.

**BDD Test Cases:**
- **Given** a workflow request is created,  
  **When** data is processed for downstream systems,  
  **Then** the data is converted into XCP format successfully.

- **Given** a data conversion fails,  
  **When** the system retries,  
  **Then** an alert is generated if the retry also fails.
