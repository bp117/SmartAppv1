User Story: Task Management System
Title: Implement a Task Management System

As a project manager,

I want to be able to create, view, update, and delete tasks for my projects,

So that I can efficiently manage my team's workload and project timelines.

Acceptance Criteria
Authentication and Authorization:

Users can sign up, log in, and log out.
There are two roles: Project Manager and Team Member.
Project Managers can create, view, update, and delete any task.
Team Members can view tasks and update the status of tasks assigned to them.
Task Creation:

A Project Manager can create tasks, specifying the task name, description, due date, and assignee.
Task Viewing:

All users can view a list of tasks, which includes task details.
Users can filter tasks by assignee, status, or due date.
Task Updating:

Project Managers can update all aspects of a task.
Team Members can update the status of a task (e.g., from "To Do" to "Done").
Task Deletion:

Project Managers can delete tasks.
Responsive UI:

The application should be responsive and usable on both desktop and mobile devices.
Technical Requirements
Backend (Spring Boot)
Security: Implement JWT-based authentication.
Database: Use JPA and Hibernate with a MySQL database to store user and task information.
REST API Endpoints:
Authentication: POST /api/auth/signup, POST /api/auth/login
Tasks: POST /api/tasks, GET /api/tasks, PUT /api/tasks/{id}, DELETE /api/tasks/{id}
Business Logic:
Ensure that only authorized users can perform actions according to their roles.
Validate task data before saving to the database.
Frontend (React)
State Management: Use React Context API or Redux for managing application state.
Forms: Implement forms for user authentication and task management operations with validation feedback.
Routing: Use React Router for navigating between different views (e.g., task list, login/signup page).
Styling: Use a CSS framework like Bootstrap or Material-UI for responsive design and UI components.
Development Workflow
Setup and Configuration:

Initialize Spring Boot project with necessary dependencies (Spring Web, Spring Security, Spring Data JPA, MySQL Driver).
Create a React app using Create React App and install dependencies for routing, state management, and UI components.
Implementing Backend:

Set up database entities and repositories for users and tasks.
Implement authentication controller and service.
Develop REST controllers for task operations, ensuring security and validation.
Implementing Frontend:

Create login and signup forms with validation.
Develop a dashboard for displaying and managing tasks, including forms for creating and editing tasks.
Implement responsive layout and navigation.
Integration and Testing:

Ensure the frontend communicates correctly with the backend through API calls.
Perform thorough testing, including unit tests for backend services and components, and end-to-end tests for critical workflows.
Deployment:

Prepare the application for production by building the React app and configuring Spring Boot for deployment.
Deploy the backend and frontend to a cloud platform like AWS or Heroku.
