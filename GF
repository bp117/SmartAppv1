2. **What challenges did you face during Global Fellows?**

It also strengthened my technical skills, particularly in web development and chatbot integration. Leadership development was another key aspect, as I learned to lead a diverse team, manage project timelines, and ensure successful collaboration among all members.

4. **One piece of advice you would like to share with employees interested in the Global Fellows program?**
   - Embrace the opportunity to step out of your comfort zone and engage with different cultures and perspectives. Be open to learning from your peers and the community you are serving. Effective communication and adaptability are crucial. Remember, the impact of your work goes beyond the immediate project; it fosters growth and creates lasting positive change for the community and yourself.


Managing a team with a mix of technical and non-technical skills was like navigating a diverse crew on a boat through uncharted waters. The technical experts were like the navigators and engineers, skilled at reading maps and maintaining the engine to ensure smooth sailing. The non-technical members were like the lookouts and deckhands, vigilant and resourceful, spotting opportunities and handling unexpected challenges. By recognizing each crew member’s unique skills and assigning them to roles where they could excel, we worked together efficiently, steering the boat towards our destination with precision and teamwork, ensuring a successful and rewarding journey.
One piece of advice I would share with employees interested in the Global Fellows program is to embrace the commitment required, even if it means spending hours beyond your typical work schedule. This experience is not just about delivering a project; it’s about making a meaningful impact and growing both personally and professionally. Balancing this additional commitment with your regular responsibilities requires time management and prioritization skills. However, the rewards—such as enhanced teamwork, leadership development, and the satisfaction of contributing to a worthy cause—are well worth the extra effort. Always remember to maintain a balance and take care of your well-being to stay energized and motivated throughout the journey.
