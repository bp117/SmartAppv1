The 5 Whys analysis is named for the approximate number of times you typically ask "Why?" to drill down to the root cause of a problem. The technique was developed by Sakichi Toyoda and used within Toyota Motor Corporation during the manufacturing process.The number 5 isn't a strict rule but rather a guideline suggesting that it usually takes about five iterations of asking "Why?" to reach the fundamental cause of a problem. The goal is to arrive at a level where further questioning does not lead to more significant insights, and you've uncovered the root cause of the issue.
