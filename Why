The 5 Whys analysis is named for the approximate number of times you typically ask "Why?" to drill down to the root cause of a problem. The technique was developed by Sakichi Toyoda and used within Toyota Motor Corporation during the manufacturing process.The number 5 isn't a strict rule but rather a guideline suggesting that it usually takes about five iterations of asking "Why?" to reach the fundamental cause of a problem. The goal is to arrive at a level where further questioning does not lead to more significant insights, and you've uncovered the root cause of the issue.
Chaos engineering is a discipline in software engineering focused on improving system resilience by intentionally introducing disturbances or chaos into systems to test their ability to withstand and recover from unexpected events. The core idea is to proactively identify and address potential weaknesses before they cause problems in production environments.

FMEA, or Failure Mode and Effects Analysis, is a systematic method used to identify and analyze potential failures in a product, process, design, or system. The goal of FMEA is to assess the potential impact of different types of failures and to implement strategies to prevent these failures or minimize their effects.
