1. Can you share a defining moment in your career that shaped your journey as a technologist?
"Your career is not defined by where you start, but by how you grow."

At the beginning of my journey, I chose to start as a professor in an engineering college, despite securing a placement at Polaris. At the time, there was a common stereotype that those who couldnâ€™t crack campus interviews ended up in teaching. Choosing academia wasnâ€™t seen as an ambition but as a fallback.

I wanted to prove them wrong. Teaching wasnâ€™t a limitationâ€”it was a stepping stone. It gave me the ability to think deeply, articulate complex ideas, and mentor future engineers. But my passion for technology never faded, and I transitioned into the industry, not as someone who failed elsewhere, but as someone who thrived on breaking barriers.

Looking back, that decision defined my resilience and hunger to grow. I didnâ€™t just find my place in technologyâ€”I earned it, built it, and proved that passion and perseverance matter more than perceptions.


2. Whatâ€™s a technology trend that youâ€™re particularly passionate about right now?
"We are moving from AI-assisted tasks to AI-driven autonomyâ€”the future belongs to agentic systems."

I am particularly passionate about the rise of agentic AI systems, where AI moves beyond being just a tool to becoming an autonomous problem-solver. Traditional AI applications required human intervention for orchestration, but with AI agents, we are seeing models that can plan, reason, and act independently based on objectives rather than just responding to prompts.

The future of autonomous AI agents will revolutionize industriesâ€”from self-driving enterprises to AI-powered research assistants, workflow automation, and decision-making systems. Weâ€™re heading towards a world where AI doesnâ€™t just answer questions but takes intelligent actions, seamlessly integrating with RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and multi-modal capabilities to drive real-world outcomes.

The next wave of innovation will be about "AI that gets things done"â€”moving from assistance to autonomous execution, with trust, safety, and alignment at the core. The opportunities are limitless, and Iâ€™m excited to be part of shaping this future! ðŸš€

3. What would be a piece of advice you would give to a young woman embarking on a career in technology?
"Self-confidence is a superpower. Once you start believing in yourself, magic starts to happen."

In technologyâ€”and in lifeâ€”your belief in yourself is your greatest strength. You will face moments of doubt, people who underestimate you, and challenges that seem impossible. But remember: you belong in the room, at the table, and in every conversation shaping the future.

"Doubt kills more dreams than failure ever will." Never let self-doubt hold you back from speaking up, taking risks, and pursuing what excites you. Seek mentors, not validation, and let your work speak louder than stereotypes.

The tech industry thrives on curiosity, innovation, and resilienceâ€”qualities that have nothing to do with gender and everything to do with passion and persistence. So, step forward boldly, own your space, and rewrite the narrativeâ€”because the future of technology needs your voice, your ideas, and your brilliance. ðŸš€


4. Whatâ€™s the biggest tech myth people still believe that you would like to bust?
"AI will replace humans."

One of the biggest myths Iâ€™d like to bust is the fear that AI will completely replace humans. The reality? AI is an enabler, not a replacement.

We are not heading towards a future where AI takes over jobs, but rather a future where AI amplifies human potential. AI automates repetitive tasks, augments decision-making, and accelerates innovation, but it still needs human intuition, creativity, and ethical reasoning to drive meaningful progress.

The real conversation should be about how we leverage AI to enhance human capabilities, not replace them. The future of work is not AI vs. humansâ€”itâ€™s AI + humans. The organizations and individuals who embrace AI as a collaborator will be the ones shaping the next era of technology. ðŸš€

5. Tell us a fun thing about yourself that most people are unlikely to know.
"Music isnâ€™t just background noiseâ€”itâ€™s my focus mode!" ðŸŽ§

Even during my college days, I would always have my earphones on while studying, tuning into music to get into the zone. That habit stuck with me, and even today, if you see me with earphones in at work, itâ€™s a sign that Iâ€™m deep into solving something important! So, no, Iâ€™m not ignoring youâ€”Iâ€™m just in "problem-solving with a soundtrack" mode! ðŸŽ¶ðŸš€
