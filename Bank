**Technical Design Using Native App Development:**

1. **Architecture:**
   - **Frontend (Mobile App):** Developed separately for iOS and Android using platform-specific technologies:
     - **iOS:** Swift and SwiftUI/Storyboard.
     - **Android:** Kotlin with Android Jetpack components.
   - **Backend:** Cloud-based microservices architecture providing APIs that will be accessed via HTTPS.

2. **Key Components:**

   - **User Location Services:**
     - **iOS (Core Location):** Use the `CLLocationManager` class for location tracking and geocoding.
     - **Android (Google Location Services):** Implement `FusedLocationProviderClient` for accurate and battery-efficient location data.
   - **Branch Locations Database:**
     - Use a geospatial database like MongoDB Atlas or PostgreSQL (with PostGIS) to store and query bank branch coordinates.

   - **Travel Time Estimation:**
     - **Maps API Integration:** Incorporate the Google Maps Directions API for both iOS and Android. Implement a wrapper to fetch real-time travel time, considering live traffic.

   - **Wait Time Estimation:**
     - **Branch Queue Data Collection:** Implement branch-level software (or IoT sensors) to measure customer presence and relay data via APIs.
     - **Predictive Models:** Backend machine learning models (Python with Scikit-learn, TensorFlow) will analyze historical data to predict wait times based on queue length.

   - **Recommendation Engine:**
     - **Backend Service:** Develop a microservice that aggregates travel time and wait time to score branches using a weighted scoring algorithm.
     - **Customer Preferences:** Incorporate customer preferences through REST API calls or persistent storage.

3. **Technology Stack:**

   - **Frontend:**
     - **iOS:** Swift with SwiftUI or Storyboard for a native UI.
     - **Android:** Kotlin with Jetpack Compose or XML layouts.
   - **Backend:**
     - **Languages:** Node.js (Express), Python (FastAPI or Flask), or Java (Spring Boot).
     - **Microservices Framework:** Docker or Kubernetes for containerization and orchestration.
     - **API Gateway:** AWS API Gateway or Azure API Management.
   - **Database:**
     - **Primary Storage:** PostgreSQL (PostGIS extension) or MongoDB for geospatial branch data.
     - **Caching:** Redis or Memcached for quick lookups.
   - **Machine Learning Models:** Deployed using TensorFlow Serving or a similar service.

4. **Security and Authentication:**
   - **OAuth 2.0:** For secure user authentication with access tokens.
   - **Encryption:** SSL/TLS for secure communications between the app and backend.
   - **Platform-specific Security:**
     - **iOS:** Use Keychain Services for storing sensitive data.
     - **Android:** Leverage EncryptedSharedPreferences for secure data storage.

5. **Deployment and Monitoring:**
   - **CI/CD:** Separate pipelines for iOS (Fastlane, GitHub Actions) and Android (Gradle, Jenkins) with automated builds, tests, and releases.
   - **Monitoring:** AWS CloudWatch, Azure Monitor, or Prometheus/Grafana for backend performance monitoring.

6. **User Interface:**
   - **Branch Map:**
     - **iOS (MapKit):** Display branches on a native map using `MKMapView`.
     - **Android (Google Maps API):** Integrate the Google Maps SDK to show branches.
   - **Branch Details:**
     - Display details like estimated travel time, wait time, and available services.
   - **Filtering & Sorting:** Allow customers to filter and sort branches based on specific needs.
   - **Push Notifications:** Remind customers of their appointments or share real-time updates.

This design will provide a comprehensive native app experience tailored to each platform while ensuring seamless communication with the backend system for intelligent branch recommendations.
