Executive-level manager accountable for setting vision and strategic direction while maximizing organizational performance; may be head of a sub-family and typically leads and manages managers and senior professionals.

I have played a pivotal role in setting the vision and strategic direction for high-impact projects. Leading the design and development of the in-house chaos engineering tool "Constrictor" was a critical accomplishment to test application resiliency, enhancing our ability to withstand disruptions. Additionally, I spearheaded the creation of the DTI API framework, which was rolled out across the entire DTI and integrated with the Orchestra platform. This framework, along with the introduction of the Spectral API linter to ensure API spec consistency with OpenAPI standards, has significantly optimized our processes and demonstrated my leadership in driving organizational performance. Furthermore, my evaluation of Backstage.io, and the rapid development of a POC to showcase its capabilities, convinced leadership of its value in creating a holistic software catalog portal to better manage microservices across the DTI
