**Subject:** Story Weaver - AI-Powered Product Management Tool Mockups Ready for Review

Hi [Leadership Team],

I'm excited to share the complete UI mockups for **Story Weaver**, our proposed AI-powered tool for product owners to streamline story creation, refinement, and management.

**What Story Weaver Does:**
- Connects to Jira boards and uses AI to analyze, refine, and generate user stories
- Provides human-in-the-loop approval workflow for all AI changes
- Integrates document context (requirements, wireframes, research) for better story quality
- Offers configurable AI prompts for different story operations

**Key Screens Included:**
- Dashboard with AI insights and recommendations
- Story management with AI analysis and refinement
- Configurable AI prompts for different use cases
- Human approval workflow (critical safety feature)
- Attachment management for context-aware generation
- Story/Feature/Epic creation with Jira integration

**Next Steps:**
Please review the attached mockups and let me know your thoughts. I'd like to schedule a 30-minute demo session to walk through the functionality and discuss potential implementation timeline.

**Expected Impact:**
- 60% reduction in story writing time
- Improved story quality and consistency
- Better sprint planning with refined requirements
- Maintained human control with AI assistance

The mockups are fully interactive - all tabs, buttons, and workflows demonstrate the complete user experience.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
