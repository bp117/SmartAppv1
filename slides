In the context of the Neuro-Link Banking Interface, whether the NPU is considered hardware or software can depend on the specific application and the architecture of the system. It could be:

A hardware component, if the system includes a dedicated chip designed specifically for processing complex neural patterns and translating them into actionable data. This would likely be the case in systems requiring real-time processing and high efficiency.
A software component, if the functionality of neural processing is implemented through software running on general computing hardware, designed to interpret neural data captured by the interface.
