Subject: Assignment: Comparative Analysis of OpenAI API Endpoints

Hi [Team Member's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. As part of our strategic approach, we are planning to enhance our API capabilities instead of creating an SDK for now. To support this, I’d like you to take the lead on conducting a comparative analysis between the API endpoints exposed by OpenAI and our in-house canonical endpoints.

Here’s what needs to be done:

1. Review OpenAI API Endpoints

Explore and document the key functionalities, response formats, and contracts exposed by OpenAI's APIs.



2. Comparative Analysis

Compare OpenAI’s API features with our canonical endpoints, identifying overlaps and gaps.



3. Identify Missing Features

Highlight any functionalities available in OpenAI’s endpoints that are missing in ours.



4. Propose Contract Updates

Suggest necessary contract changes or enhancements to make our endpoints more aligned with OpenAI’s features and standards.



5. Documentation

Compile a detailed report summarizing your findings, highlighting missing elements, and recommending changes.




This analysis will help us align our offerings with industry standards without needing an SDK in the short term. Please let me know if you need access to OpenAI’s API documentation or any other resources to get started.

Let’s aim to complete this by [specific deadline]. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need clarification.

Looking forward to your insights!

Best regards,
[Your Name]
