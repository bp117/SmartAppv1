Here’s a detailed description of the panels displayed in the Grafana dashboard based on the screenshot provided:


---

1. Number of Facilities Processed

Description: Displays the total number of facilities that have been processed. It provides an overview of the operational scale and the number of facilities currently handled by the system.



---

2. Number of Files Processed

Description: Represents the total count of files successfully processed across all facilities. This metric highlights the overall workload and throughput of the processing pipeline.



---

3. Maximum File Size

Description: Shows the size of the largest file processed in megabytes (MB). This panel helps identify outliers in file size that may affect processing performance.



---

4. Minimum File Size

Description: Displays the smallest file size in the system (in MB). Useful for understanding the range of file sizes being handled.



---

5. Number of PCF Instances

Description: Represents the total number of PCF (platform instances) being utilized for file processing. It provides insight into resource utilization.



---

6. Average Processing Time Per File

Description: Displays the average time taken to process each file (in seconds). This metric helps evaluate the efficiency of the processing pipeline.



---

7. Average File Size

Description: Shows the average file size (in MB) processed across all facilities. It provides insight into the typical file size handled by the system.



---

8. File Size Distribution

Description: A bar chart that categorizes files by size ranges (e.g., <10MB, 10–100MB, >100MB). This panel gives a visual breakdown of file size distribution, helping to identify trends and anomalies.



---

9. Overall File Processing Status

Description: A pie chart that represents the status of file processing. The segments (e.g., success, failure, progress) visually depict the percentage of files in each status category.



---

10. Distinct Doc Types Count by Facility

Description: Displays the count of distinct document types processed across different facilities. This metric helps identify diversity in document types and how they vary across facilities.



---

11. File Count by Doc Type

Description: Lists the number of files processed for each document type. This panel provides insights into which document types are most frequently processed.



---

12. Total Failed Files

Description: Highlights the total count of files that failed processing. This panel is critical for monitoring system reliability and identifying areas for improvement.



---

13. Error by File Type

Description: A bar chart that breaks down the count of errors by file type. This visualization helps pinpoint specific file types prone to errors.



---

14. Failed File Summary

Description: Displays a summary of failure reasons (e.g., "No space on PCF instance," "Resources exhausted"). This panel is useful for root cause analysis of failures.



---

15. Comparison Metrics

Description: A table summarizing the comparison results between expected and actual outcomes. Categories include matches, non-matches, partial matches, and missing values. It highlights data quality and consistency metrics.



---

16. Number of Errors

Description: Captures the count of errors categorized by error type. This provides a granular breakdown of issues encountered during processing.



---

These panel descriptions can be used in documentation or to provide context to users monitoring the dashboard. Let me know if you'd like further refinements or additional descriptions.

You're correct! The "Number of Errors" panel in this case should indeed represent the "Total Failed Files". Here's the corrected description:


---

16. Total Failed Files

Description: Represents the total count of files that encountered errors during processing. This panel tracks the number of files that failed due to issues like missing data, processing errors, or system failures. It provides an overview of system reliability and error frequency.
