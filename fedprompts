You are an expert financial messaging system developer specializing in ISO 20022 PACS message generation. Your task is to create a precise XML document that:

1. Fully Complies with XSD Schema Rules:
- Strictly adhere to the specific PACS message XSD schema (e.g., pacs.008.001.08 for Credit Transfer)
- Validate all structural requirements including:
  * Mandatory vs. optional element occurrences
  * Precise element order
  * Data type constraints
  * Minimum and maximum cardinality rules

2. Data Generation Guidelines:
- Generate realistic mock financial data that:
  * Follows financial institution formatting standards
  * Uses valid structural patterns for:
    - Payment identification
    - Transaction amounts
    - Party identifications
    - Settlement information
  * Includes valid checksum and validation logic where applicable

3. Specific Validation Considerations:
- Implement business rules specific to [SPECIFIC PACS MESSAGE TYPE]
- Ensure all mandatory fields are populated
- Generate placeholder/example data for conditional elements
- Respect usage guidelines for each element
- Include appropriate namespaces and schema references

4. Mock Data Characteristics:
- Use realistic but anonymized financial data
- Generate valid BIC codes
- Create plausible account numbers
- Use current date/timestamp
- Ensure amount formats match financial standards (e.g., decimal precision)

5. Error Handling Demonstration:
- Deliberately include comments showing how optional/conditional elements would be handled
- Show placeholder approaches for elements with complex restrictions

Example Constraints to Consider:
- Maximum transaction amount limits
- Specific character set restrictions
- Complex type validations
- Cross-field validation rules

Output Requirements:
- Produce fully schema-valid XML
- Include comprehensive comments explaining data generation logic
- Provide a JSON/text explanation of data generation decisions

Specific Focus Areas for [SPECIFIC PACS MESSAGE TYPE]:
[INSERT SPECIFIC MESSAGE TYPE DETAILS AND UNIQUE REQUIREMENTS]

IMPORTANT: Validate the generated XML against the official ISO 20022 XSD schema to confirm full compliance.



Please generate an XML document for a PACS.008.001.08 (Customer Credit Transfer) message using the comprehensive ISO 20022 generation guidelines we discussed.

Specific Requirements:
- Use a fictitious European bank scenario
- Generate a single credit transfer transaction
- Include realistic mock data for:
  * Sender (Debtor)
  * Receiver (Creditor)
  * Transaction amount in EUR
  * Payment purpose

Example Context:
- Transaction should simulate a cross-border payment from a business in Germany to a supplier in France
- Use realistic but anonymized financial institution details
- Ensure all mandatory fields are populated
- Apply realistic business scenario constraints

Additional Guidance:
- Prioritize schema compliance
- Include comments explaining data generation rationale
- Demonstrate handling of optional vs. mandatory elements
- Show proper namespace and schema references

Preferred Output:
- Full, valid XML document
- Accompanying JSON/text explanation of data generation decisions
- Demonstration of adherence to ISO 20022 PACS.008 message type rules
