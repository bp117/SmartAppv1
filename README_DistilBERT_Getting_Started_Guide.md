# Getting Started with DistilBERT Locally

This guide provides an overview of how to set up and use the DistilBERT model from Hugging Face's Transformers library for various NLP tasks such as text classification, tokenization, and embedding extraction locally.

## Environment Setup

Ensure Python 3.6 or newer is installed on your system. You can check your Python version by running:

```bash
python --version
```

## Installation

Install PyTorch and the Transformers library to use DistilBERT. Run the following command:

```bash
pip install torch transformers
```

## Downloading DistilBERT Model

Use the following Python code to download the DistilBERT model and tokenizer:

```python
from transformers import DistilBertTokenizer, DistilBertModel

# Load pre-trained model tokenizer (vocabulary)
tokenizer = DistilBertTokenizer.from_pretrained('distilbert-base-uncased')

# Load pre-trained model
model = DistilBertModel.from_pretrained('distilbert-base-uncased')
```

## Tokenization

Tokenize your input text with the following code:

```python
input_text = "Hello, world! This is a test sentence."
encoded_input = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors='pt')
```

## Feature Extraction

Extract features from your tokenized text as follows:

```python
with torch.no_grad():
    outputs = model(**encoded_input)
last_hidden_states = outputs.last_hidden_state
```

## Saving and Loading the Model

To save the model and tokenizer locally:

```python
model.save_pretrained('./distilbert_local')
tokenizer.save_pretrained('./distilbert_local')
```

To load them:

```python
model = DistilBertModel.from_pretrained('./distilbert_local')
tokenizer = DistilBertTokenizer.from_pretrained('./distilbert_local')
```

## Next Steps

You're now ready to integrate DistilBERT into your applications for a variety of NLP tasks. Adjust the provided examples according to your specific project needs.
