Problem Statement Document for Chat with Fargo using Sign Language

Introduction
As digital interfaces become increasingly ubiquitous, the need to make these technologies accessible to all users, including those with hearing impairments, has never been more critical. Sign language is a primary mode of communication for many in the deaf and hard-of-hearing community. Developing a virtual assistant capable of understanding and generating sign language can significantly enhance accessibility and user experience.

Problem Statement
The challenge lies in creating a virtual assistant, named Fargo, that can interpret and communicate in sign language in real-time. This involves not only the recognition of sign language gestures but also the accurate translation of these gestures into text or speech and vice versa. The solution must be responsive, accurate, and capable of handling a conversational interface that operates in a natural and intuitive manner for sign language users.

Proposed Solution
Develop "Fargo," a sign language-capable virtual assistant that:
- Uses computer vision and machine learning to interpret sign language from video input.
- Translates sign language gestures into text and synthesized speech.
- Generates sign language animations or avatars in real-time to communicate responses back to the user.
- Integrates with various platforms to provide services ranging from information retrieval to controlling smart home devices, all accessible via sign language.

Solution Details
1. Sign Language Recognition: Implement a deep learning model trained on a comprehensive dataset of sign language gestures to recognize and interpret signs accurately.
2. Translation and Response Generation: Use NLP to translate recognized signs into appropriate text and responses, which are then converted into speech or text.
3. Real-Time Animation: Develop or integrate a real-time animation system that uses avatars to mimic human sign language gestures for visual output.
4. User Interface: Design a user-friendly interface that displays the virtual assistant and allows users to interact through a webcam or mobile device camera.

Technologies
- AI and Machine Learning: TensorFlow, PyTorch for gesture recognition models.
- Computer Vision: OpenCV for image processing.
- Natural Language Processing: Google Cloud Speech-to-Text, IBM Watson for text and speech translation.
- Animation: Unity or Unreal Engine for creating realistic avatars.
- Integration: APIs for integration with smart devices and information systems.

Estimated Efforts in Hours
- Setup: 30 hours
- Design/Analysis: 50 hours
- Development: 200 hours
- Testing: 100 hours
- Demo Preparation: 20 hours

Demo
The project will culminate in a demo where Fargo will interact with users via sign language, showcasing its ability to understand queries and respond both textually and through sign language animations.

Takeaway for Interns
Interns will gain experience in:
- Advanced areas of AI including computer vision and natural language processing.
- Developing accessible technology interfaces.
- Working on interdisciplinary teams that blend technology, linguistics, and user experience design.

Conclusion
This project aims not only to push the envelope in AI and accessibility technology but also to bridge communication gaps for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community, demonstrating a significant step towards inclusive technology.
