Here’s the feedback for Mayank, incorporating his contributions along with a tone of appreciation and developmental encouragement:



1. When you consider the employee’s recent performance, what projects or accomplishments stand out? Why?
Mayank has been a consistent and valuable contributor to the Tachyon platform. Along with working on the Use Case Canvas and the Tachyon Crew desktop app, he also developed key tools and agents for the MCP (Model Context Protocol) ecosystem. His work has helped streamline internal workflows and added tangible value to our agentic development efforts.

2. What did the employee do well? Provide example(s).
Mayank demonstrated strong technical learning and adaptability, quickly upskilling in PyQt6 and applying it effectively in the development of the Crew desktop application. His additional contributions to building MCP tools and agents show initiative beyond his core tasks. Like Harshit, Mayank was dependable during critical phases and played a crucial role in ensuring smooth delivery.

3. What areas could the employee improve or further develop? Provide example(s).
As Mayank continues to grow, one area of focus could be strengthening communication around design decisions and seeking early feedback. Participating more actively in peer discussions and contributing to cross-team technical conversations will help him further evolve into a well-rounded engineer.

4. What additional feedback or advice would you provide?
Mayank’s enthusiasm for solving problems and exploring new areas like MCP tooling is commendable. He is encouraged to continue this proactive mindset and also explore mentorship opportunities with incoming grads or interns. With his balanced skill set and eagerness to contribute, he is on a strong trajectory for growth.



Recommendation for Exceeds Expectations – Harshit

Harshit has consistently demonstrated performance well beyond that expected of a new graduate. He took complete ownership of two critical components — the Use Case Canvas and the Tachyon Crew desktop app — both of which are central to the user experience on the Tachyon platform. What sets Harshit apart is not just the delivery, but the way he approached the challenge: he proactively upskilled himself in PyQt6, worked independently to solve problems, and ensured all milestones were met despite facing health issues.

His professionalism, reliability during high-pressure timelines, and ability to deliver production-grade outcomes with minimal supervision clearly place him in the “Exceeds Expectations” category.

Recommendation for Exceeds Expectations – Mayank

Mayank’s contributions have been equally impactful. In addition to developing the Use Case Canvas and Crew desktop app alongside Harshit, he independently built critical tools and agents for the MCP (Model Context Protocol) framework. This required a deeper understanding of the agent ecosystem and internal platform integrations — something he picked up and executed on without being explicitly guided.

He showed initiative, strong problem-solving ability, and delivered outcomes that enhanced the internal developer experience. His ability to independently own and deliver across multiple parallel workstreams, while also learning and applying new technologies, firmly supports a rating of “Exceeds Expectations.”
